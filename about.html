                    <p>My main goal is to positively impact my environment.
                        <br>
                        This is the legacy I inherited from my parents who were natives of
                        the country and fought for its establishment.
                        <br>
                        This is also the legacy of My grandparents
                        who came to Israel in the second and third "aliyah" (immigration to Israel) and established
                        their home here.
                        <br>
                        TerraGenie platform was formed based on these values,
                        in a wonderful sequence of events our friend Dor Yalon and I applied such innovative
                        capabilities that changed
                        the daily lives of many of our customers,
                        <br>
                        The most rewarding thing for me is to gain the appreciation of the customers who,
                        thanks to this unique technology, can survey professionally and easily and in a way they never
                        thought possible at all.
                        <br>
                        For me, that is goal achievement
