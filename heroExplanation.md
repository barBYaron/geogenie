all sht 'index.ts' file will be translated to 'index.js' file.

the 'index.js' file and the 'stayle.css' file will be connected to al of
the 'html' files.

every cheange in the 'scss' we will press 'ctrl + s' and the 'scss' will be saved and translated to 'css'.

because the we hav a main explorer, we will see the cheange in the 'css' file and 
the 'js' file just after we copy the 'css' file and the 'js' file to the main explorer.

the 'js' we work with is in 'dist' folder.
and the 'css' we work with is in 'dist' folder that in 'css' folder.
